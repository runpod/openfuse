# OpenFuse

## Mission

Build the best UI/UX tools to make AI generally accessible.

## UI/UX

UI/UX will be open-source and PRs are welcome by everyone. We will strive to keep everything simple and open.

## GPU Compute

For simple inference, we plan to keep it free until we go broke. For features like DreamBooth, there will have to be a paid version due to the sheer amount of cost.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# install all packages
yarn install
# run dev server
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.
